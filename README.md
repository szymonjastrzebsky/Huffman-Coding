# Huffman Compression and Encryption

This project implements a two-stage data processing pipeline combining Huffman compression with encryption, and the corresponding decompression and decryption process. It's designed to efficiently compress and secure text data, making it ideal for storage and transmission.

## Features

- **Compression and Decompression**: Implements Huffman coding to efficiently compress and decompress text data.
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Adds a layer of security by encrypting compressed data and allowing for its subsequent decryption.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or later
- No external libraries are required for the core functionality.
